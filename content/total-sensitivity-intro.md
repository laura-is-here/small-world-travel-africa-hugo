Mary & Jonah Gokova have decades of experience working for economic development, peace and social justice.  They have strong ties to civil society and faith-based organizations.

Their Total Sensitivity programme provides opportunities for people with very different experiences to learn and grow by getting to know each other.  This Zimbabwe-based program offers services to (visitors, students, workers, Faith based, gender and socio-economic justice groups) who want to broaden their cultural experience.  

Mary and Jonah can organize a custom program based on your group's needs and interests.
