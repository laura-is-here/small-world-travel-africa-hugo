## Zimbabwe Travel Tips

Our partners provide services that will make your trip to Zimbabwe as comfortable and succesful as possible; however, we feel it's necessary to provide some important infomation regarding travel to Zimbabwe.

- Check current conditions before venturing into Zimbabwe. The country’s economy is in freefall, daily electric power outages are the norm, petrol shortages are frequent. We’ve found that the British Foreign Office travel advisories are far more precise guide to current conditions than those offered by the U.S. State Department. As the advisories warn, foreign visitors should stay away from political demonstrations, as demonstrators always face the risk of violence by security forces. 

- If you choose to visit, you will also quickly learn that hardship has made Zimbabweans wonderfully resourceful. The nation’s major cell phone company, which also functions as its principal bank via its phone-based money transfer service, has become one of the world’s largest purchasers of Tesla solar energy storage batteries, which it uses to keep the money flowing. Local currency is nearly worthless, but credit cards backed by U.S. dollars are welcomed widely.
